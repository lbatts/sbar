# sbar - Stage-based assessments in R 

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

sbar is a package that provides functions to allow the user to run various stage-based fisheries assessments in R. The stage-based assesments available are versions of the current (2020) Catch-Survey Analysis (CSA) found in the the NOAA Fish and Fisheries Toolbox and an implementation of a size-based delay-diffrenec model described in the throerteical paper by Schnute (1987). Model theory, implementation and testing are detailed in ........

## Installation
This package involves C++ code and the modelling framework of the package \code{TMB}.  Please ensure that you are able to compile source code and that this package is running smoothly on your device.

And sbar package can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lbatts/sbar")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(sbar)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
